# Contributing
We're excited that you want to contribute to this project! After all, this API is for everybody! 

## New Features
If you have a new feature you'd like to see happen, open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/SaltyQuetzals/Good-Bull-API/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). These issues let us know what you hope to see added, and why you think it's important.

__PLEASE NOTE__: This API is intended to be a data source and __READ ONLY__. The only way that data should be changing is if the output of the scrapers changes. We will not be accepting any kind of write functionality, nor will we be serving data that cannot be drawn from a [tamu.edu] domain.

## Missing/Incorrect Data
Something missing from the scraped data? Is an instructor listed incorrectly? Is a section not listed as honors or special topics when it should be? Please open a [missing/incorrect data issue](https://github.com/SaltyQuetzals/Good-Bull-API/issues/new?template=missing-incorrect-data.md)! This kind of scraping is difficult and we're bound to make mistakes.

## Bugs
Is there a bug in the API? Please open a [bug issue](https://github.com/SaltyQuetzals/Good-Bull-API/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), and be descriptive as to what sequence of events you performed that caused the bug. If we can't reproduce your bug, we can't fix it!
